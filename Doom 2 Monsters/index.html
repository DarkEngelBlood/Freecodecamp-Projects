        <p>Doom II: Hell on Earth is the first sequel to Doom, released by id Software on September 30, 1994, followed by the official release party on October 10. Featuring 32 levels in a single linear episode, Doom II continues Doom's story, seeing the player returning to Earth to single-handedly fight off an invasion of the planet by demons.<br>
<br>
Doom II includes several gameplay enhancements over the original Doom. Most notable are the introduction of several new monster types, plus an additional weapon (the super shotgun). While the original game was distributed via shareware and mail order (to purchase the full game), Doom II was the first game developed by id Software to be sold commercially in stores, with cooperation of distributor GT Interactive. This represented a change in business model for id that would later be adopted more widely.</p>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/8/8f/Former_Human.png" alt="A zombieman firing the player">
        <article>
          <p>The zombieman (also called the former human in the game manuals, and often referred to colloquially by the Doom community as the trooper) is the least powerful enemy in the game, intended as the first enemy a new Doom player will face. A zombieman is described as a space marine which has been turned into a zombie during the invasion from Hell. The monster appears as a man in a bloodied tan uniform and body armor, carrying a rifle. His hair has an unusual greenish tinge, perhaps stained with nukage, reminiscent of the odd hair colors that often occur in comic books, anime, and animated works of art.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"Just a few days ago, you were probably swapping war stories with one of these guys. Now it's time to swap some lead upside their head."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The zombieman will make one of three different sounds when alerted: two animalistic roars, and an inarticulate chatter sound. All three zombie types make the same sounds when they spot the player. The zombieman is armed with a rifle that fires bullets that are slightly less damaging than the player's bullets. When the zombie attacks, it aims its rifle at the player for a short time (10 tics) and fires a single pellet. The zombieman's weapon has a wide dispersal (standard deviation around 9°, to a maximum of ±22°), and will most likely miss at medium to long ranges. After firing, the monster resumes walking to its target.</li>
            <li>The zombieman is generally considered the least dangerous enemy in the game; no other monster (excepting the Commander Keen) has a lower movement rate, hit point total, or average damage per attack. When killed, the zombieman falls hard on its back with various bits of blood and flesh blown off its form as it lets out either an agonized moan or scream, dropping an ammo clip containing 5 bullets (or 10 on I'm too young to die and Nightmare!); if he subsequently respawns or is resurrected, the zombie will drop another clip each time it is killed again. It can also be gibbed if attacked with powerful weaponry, such as a rocket launcher.</li>

          <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/7/7e/Sgtnojoi.png" alt="Six shotgun guy in front of the player">
        <article>
          <p>The shotgun guy, also called the former human sergeant in the game manuals, and sometimes shortened to sergeant, is an armored space marine which has been turned into a zombie during the invasion from Hell. The monster appears as a red-eyed bald man wearing bloodstained slate-gray body armor and clothing, and wields a shotgun. Angrier in appearance than the lowly zombieman, and around three times as powerful, a shotgun guy can challenge the most hardened of Doom veterans.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>This type of zombie is armed with a shotgun, which is less powerful than the player's shotgun: one round produces only three pellets instead of seven, and each pellet inflicts slightly less damage on average. When the shotgun guy attacks, it aims its shotgun at the player for about 3/10 of a second and fires a single round. Each pellet has the same dispersal as a trooper's bullet (standard deviation around 9°, to a maximum of ±22°); this is calculated independently for each pellet, so multiple hits are occasionally scored even at very long range. After firing, the monster moves again.</li>
            <li>When killed, the shotgun guy drops its weapon, which contains 4 shells (or 8 on I'm too young to die and Nightmare!). If it subsequently respawns or is resurrected, the shotgun remains. The shotgun guy's chest and its abdomen spill blood as it is felled, assuming it is not gibbed, which is not uncommon, considering its relatively low number of hit points.</li>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/b/b3/Imp.png" alt="An Imp in front of the player">
        <article>
          <p>The imp is a human-sized, humanoid, fireball-flinging monster, the most common opponent encountered in id Software's Doom and Doom II. It is leather brown in color, with red eyes, numerous white bony spikes protruding from its body, and sharp white claws on its hands and feet. Imps encourage new players to practice strafing.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"You thought an imp was a cute little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork. Where did these brown bastards come from? They heave balls o' fire down your throat and take several bullets to die. It's time to find a weapon better than that pistol if you're going to face more than one of these S.O.B.s."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>An imp will make one of two different loud, serpentine hisses when it is alerted. An imp attacks by hurling a single bright red fireball, which inflicts projectile damage when it strikes another living object. At melee range, it uses its razor-sharp claws to scratch; if its target moves out of range before this attack has followed through, the imp will proceed to shoot a fireball instead. When killed without being gibbed, an imp will randomly emit one of two distinct low-pitched snarls, as it falls on its back and a hole opens up in its midsection, disgorging plentiful amounts of blood.</li>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/a/a8/Demon-Doom2-map03.png" alt="A demon in front of the player">
        <article>
          <p>The demon is a pink, bulky, somewhat ape-like monster with small horns, dinosaur-like legs and feet, and a large, bloody mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The demon and its partially invisible counterpart, the spectre, are unique in their exclusivity to melee attacks, requiring the monster to be near the player in order to deal any damage. To make up for this, the demon's fast speed and zig-zag motions allow it to cover more ground and dodge the player's fire.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Demons let out a sort of growling snort when spotting a player. Demons do not have a ranged attack, so they are no threat at long range. However, they have a huge speed advantage over many of the lower-ranked enemies. They can outrun any monster except the charging lost soul, the cyberdemon, the revenant, and the arch-vile. Due to its speed, the demon closes distances very quickly, often running toward the player in a zig-zag pattern, making it harder to hit, and helping corner the player. Under Nightmare! or with the fast monsters setting, the demon moves and attacks twice as fast, thus becoming the fastest monster in the game, and the second quickest to attack, after the cyberdemon.</li>
            <li>In the original Doom, demons were usually found alone or in small numbers, but in Doom II, which offers the player the powerful super shotgun, they are often found in larger packs and are quick to swarm and overwhelm the player from all angles if they are given enough running room. They emit a loud gurgling sound and spit up some teeth and blood when they are killed.</li>

        <article>
          <p>Spectres are partially invisible, ethereal beings which, except for their fuzzy, blurred appearance, are exactly the same as the demon in behavior and attributes. They often hide in darkened areas, waiting to startle players. Spectres do not have states or sprites of their own, but instead share them entirely with the demon.<br>
<br>
Spectres appear as shimmering beings, acting like a lens which distorts and reflects the light passing around and through their translucent bodies, making them hard to spot in dark areas or against certain textures, such as grey speckled walls. However, in bright areas, they are noticeably visible and spotty.</p>

        <header>Baron of Hell</header>
        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/5/54/Barons_of_Hell.png" alt="Two Barons attacking the player">
        <article>
          <p>The baron of Hell is an enemy monster which resembles a minotaur, faun or satyr with a pink torso, brown goat legs, and a skeletal face.<br>
<br>
A pair of barons, referred to internally by id Software as the "bruiser brothers," star as the bosses at the end of Knee-Deep in the Dead, the first episode of Doom. Barons also appear as regular enemies in the later episodes and in the sequels; coincidentally, they and their weaker counterparts the Hell knights frequently appear in pairs.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Baron attacks are dodged easily if the player is giving him full attention, but his Hell-energy fireballs are faster than those of imps or cacodemons and can do very heavy damage on a successful hit. Because barons take very heavy beatings before going down, and because their pain chance is low, use of the rocket launcher, plasma rifle, or super shotgun is recommended. However, provided that the player can get at sufficient range without being hit, the chaingun and shotgun will also work, but may take a while. Melee attacks against them are hazardous, as they put the player at risk of being clawed.</li>
            <li>To kill them requires about 5 rockets, 45 plasma shots, 100 bullets, 11 seconds with the chainsaw, 15 well-placed shotgun blasts, or 5 point-blank super shotgun blasts. The BFG9000's main plasma ball does not deal enough damage to kill a baron in one shot, although the subsequent blast rays may deal a killing blow to the baron if enough of them strike the target. This is best achieved by firing the BFG at point-blank range, which leaves the player vulnerable to the baron's extremely damaging melee attack during the BFG's charge cycle. When killed, a baron will make a high-pitched gurgling sound as its body splits in half, exposing copious amounts of green blood and intestines.</li>
            <li>They excel at monster infighting because of their amount of health and damaging attacks, and their status is only rivaled by the cyberdemon and spiderdemon.</li>
            <li>Despite their endurance, barons of Hell often pose a lesser immediate threat than some of the weaker monsters because they make a single attack without special effects and, given sufficient space, their fireballs are not too hard to dodge (especially by circlestrafing). In confined spaces, however, they are hard to move around and can be more lethal.</li>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/e/ef/Cacodemon_encounter.png" alt="A Cacodemon in front of the player">
        <article>
          <p>Cacodemons are bumpy red monsters with large spherical bodies, crowned with horns. Cacodemons float slowly through the air, over ledges and through open windows. They have a single green eye placed above a large wickedly grinning mouth, showing a series of nasty teeth and a bluish, electrified interior. Given their floating abilities, cacodemons can roam virtually anywhere in their attempts to seek out the player.<br>
<br>
Given its unique, "hideously cute" appearance, the cacodemon has become popular as an unofficial mascot in the Doom community.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"They float in the air, belch ball-lightning, and boast one Hell of a big mouth. You're toast if you get too close to these monstrosities."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Cacodemons attack by spitting a ball of lightning, or by biting with their gaping maw. The cacodemon often seems to distance itself from the player when under attack, though the cause of this is that it is being pushed back by successful hits from its enemies. Biting attacks are a rare occurrence due to this behavior, but can be seen in close quarters with low ceilings.</li>
            <li>Cacodemons emit a loud hissing sound when they first see the player or otherwise become active, and use the pain sound shared by most of the demonic monsters from Doom. When killed, they let out a gurgling moan and fall from the air, splitting open like rotten melons as they crash. These death animation frames are unique, as they depict the monster in agony, spewing copious amounts of blue blood, with its intestines and eye flying out upon impact with the ground.</li>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/c/c8/Lost_Souls_MAP20.png" alt="Six Lost Souls in front the player">
        <article>
          <p>The lost soul is a flaming, floating skull with horns, first introduced in Doom's second episode, The Shores of Hell. Lost souls use themselves as weapons, charging towards the player with open jaws. Given its tendency to charge suddenly, its quickness to retaliate upon being attacked, and its ability to crowd the player, a lost soul can be a considerable annoyance. Doom II finds a new use for the lost soul by employing it as the projectile attack of the game's new pain elemental monster.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Arguably one of the most frustrating enemies in the Doom games, the lost soul floats about at a leisurely pace until it decides to attack, at which point it launches itself towards its target at high speed with a hissing breath sound, often the first audible warning of their presence. Unlike all other monsters, the lost soul is completely silent when alerted, giving it an element of stealth. If a lost soul's attack misses, it will continue careening through the air until it strikes a wall or other object. A lost soul's charge can be intercepted by a projectile or hitscan attack; when this happens, the impact negates the lost soul's momentum without interrupting the charge and as a result the monster will slowly drift, still considered as being in a charge but unable to perform any other action until it collides with something. On maps with large open areas, like E3M6: Mt. Erebus, a lost soul that missed or was pushed back can travel for a long while before being able to become active again.</li>
            <li>The lost soul is one of two monsters that do not leave a corpse (the other being the pain elemental); it simply explodes. Because of this, the lost soul does not normally respawn when the Nightmare! skill level is chosen or the -respawn parameter is used. The lost soul will however leave a small pile of gibs if it is crushed while dying, in a similar manner to the pain elemental. Regardless, it is not possible for an arch-vile to resurrect a lost soul even if it is crushed while it dies, as it does not have the necessary resurrection frames.</li>

        <img src="https://doomwiki.org/w/images/8/84/Spider.png" alt="The spider mastermind about to shoot the player">
        <article>
          <p>The spiderdemon, called the spider mastermind in The Ultimate Doom, Doom II, Final Doom and the Depths of Doom Trilogy's manual, is the boss of the final episode of Doom, Inferno, and again of the final episode of The Ultimate Doom, Thy Flesh Consumed. The PlayStation version of Doom in turn features two spiderdemons as the bosses of its final level, Redemption Denied on higher skill levels. The spiderdemon has 3000 hit points and is one of the toughest creatures in the game. The spiderdemon appears as a huge brain with facial features on it, mounted atop a cybernetic chassis with four mechanical legs and a super chaingun, making it similar to a spider at first glance.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"You guess the Arachnotrons had to come from somewhere. Hi, mom. She doesn't have a plasma gun, so thank heaven for small favors. Instead, she has a super-chaingun. Crap."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A spiderdemon emits a demonic roar which starts low-pitched but progressively "grows" in a crescendo to a high-pitched tone once activated. The huge 'super chaingun' on the spiderdemon's chassis fires three bullets with every shot, much like the shotgun guy's shotgun, but at a rapid rate of 467 shots per minute. When a spiderdemon begins firing, it will not stop until its target moves out of view or dies, or if it is stunned (where it will walk a bit immediately after the pain state) or killed. Similar behavior can be observed in the heavy weapon dude and the arachnotron.</li>
            <li>Spiderdemons, like cyberdemons, are immune to all blast damage, taking only direct hit damage from hits. This means a greater number of rockets or arch-vile blasts are required to kill them than might be expected.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The cyberdemon is a towering, hellish marriage of demon flesh and technology, with a gigantic muscular stature, a minotaur-like head with prominent black and gray horns, a gored humanoid torso filled with red wiring, a metallic prosthetic right leg, and a large rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. By far the most formidable enemy in classic Doom, and one of the most intimidating boss monsters in video game history, it is more than capable of taking out a healthy player in one hit from its arm-grafted weapon.<br>
<br>
This monster first appears as a boss at the end of Doom level E2M8, and re-appears in the secret level E3M9. In the Ultimate Doom expansion, it makes additional appearances on E4M2, E4M6, and E4M7. The cyberdemon is featured on the retail box cover of Doom II, and it appears sparingly throughout the single-player game.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"A missile-launching skyscraper with goat legs. 'Nuff said."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A cyberdemon will let out a loud animalistic, bovine-like roar when it spots a player - loud enough to be heard no matter how far away it is from the player. It attacks by firing barrages of three rockets. It has 4000 hit points and does not receive splash damage from explosions, making it fairly difficult to kill. It is also the fastest moving monster in the original game (the lost soul's charge attack not withstanding), and second fastest in Doom II (after the arch-vile). When destroyed, the cyberdemon's body will instantly dissolve into voluminous reddish clouds of flesh, blood and gore, leaving only his blood-soaked hooves; as he explodes, he lets out a short roar that is abruptly interrupted by the sound of his body exploding.</li>
            <li>The cyberdemon's rockets are the same as the player's rockets; however as all projectiles shot by monsters, they do not damage other monsters of the same type. Furthermore, the cyberdemon and the spiderdemon take only direct hit damage, and are immune to all blast damage. Therefore, a greater number of rockets is required to kill these bosses than might be expected, and they must be direct hits. This immunity to blast damage also precludes players from attaining cheap damage/kills by either of the following methods: tricking the cyberdemon into firing rockets while it stands against an obstacle such as a wall or pillar, or running point blank up against the cyberdemon while invulnerable through the use of cheats or artifacts.</li>
            <li>The cyberdemon is given a higher probability of performing his attack than other monsters, causing him to launch volleys of rockets at a high frequency. In common with other monsters, although the cyberdemon is shown with his rocket launcher in his left hand, the rockets emerge from his middle. While the cyberdemon does not have a melee attack in the PC and Doom 64 games, an apparently unintentional one does exist in the Super NES port: if the player is close enough to one in this version of the game, its attack consists of the rocket firing animation, but a scratching sound is heard with no rocket being fired.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The heavy weapon dude, referred to as the former commando in the Doom II manual, and often called the chaingunner, is the third and most powerful type of human trooper which has been turned into a zombie during the invasion of Earth by Hell. It is the first of the new enemies introduced in Doom II to make an appearance in the game. The heavy weapon dude is a robust, red-eyed bald man with a bloody mouth, wearing bloodstained, red body armor and boots over slate-gray pants, and carries a chaingun with its accompanying ammo belt. Its skin tone is darker than other zombies, and it is larger in breadth and stature. Its attack behavior of firing until its target is out of view, shared with the arachnotron and spiderdemon, can make mincemeat out of the toughest of Doom marines.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The heavy weapon dude attacks by firing its chaingun, which does slightly less damage per bullet than the player's chaingun and has a rate of fire that is also slightly lower. However, once it begins to fire, it continues firing while standing still until its target either dies or leaves its line of sight, or the monster is stunned (causing it to move immediately afterward) or destroyed.</li>
            <li>When killed, its right side rips apart, with the head exploding, and the right arm falls off as the other half of the body collapses backward. It drops the chaingun, which contains 10 bullets, or 20 on the "I'm too young to die" and "Nightmare!" skill levels. If the monster subsequently respawns or is resurrected, the chaingun remains. In common with other monsters, although the chaingunner's weapon is shown in his right hand, the bullets emerge from his middle.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The Hell knight is an enemy introduced in Doom II, a weaker version of the baron of Hell. This new monster has a tan torso, as opposed to the baron's pink coloration.<br>
<br>
In terms of gameplay, the Hell knight is identical to the baron of Hell, merely with half the hit points. As a result, it is a medium strength monster that is more vulnerable than the baron to small arms fire (eg., the shotgun or chaingun), but much more durable than an imp. It allows Doom II maps to host a weaker monster, albeit with high attack power, giving the player a decent amount of challenge without slowing down the action.</p>

            <li>Hell knight fireballs are faster than imp and cacodemon fireballs and inflict heavy damage. They have a low pain chance that makes the rocket launcher, plasma gun and super shotgun the most effective weapons against them. The chaingun and shotgun are also effective at close range. It is not recommended to use a melee attack due to their own scratching melee attack; however, five punches from a player powered up by a berserk will usually kill one. A player attempting such an attack must move in quickly to attack and quickly withdraw to avoid the counterattack.</li>
            <li>Roughly speaking, killing a Hell knight requires either 50 bullets, 6 seconds with the chainsaw, 8 close range shotgun blasts, 3 point-blank super shotgun blasts, 3 rocket hits or 23 energy cell shots. A single close range hit by the BFG9000 easily dispatches a Hell knight but it is usually a waste of ammo unless attacking several simultaneously.</li>

          <p>Revenants are monsters introduced in Doom II that are easily recognized by their high-pitched shriek. They take the form of very tall animated skeletons in silver metal body armor equipped with shoulder-mounted missile launchers, and blood and gore running down their legs. Their running movements are a herky-jerky approach akin to a stringed puppet.</p>

          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A revenant emits a loud, high-pitched, hollow scream when spotting the player.</li>
            <li>Revenants fire two varieties of missiles, unguided and homing. The homing missiles can be distinguished by a gray smoke trail. During melee combat they can also strike a blow with one of their large fists, complete with an exaggerated punching sound effect. Revenants have a unique characteristic unlike any other monster that has a melee attack: when the distance to its target is less than 196 units, the revenant abandons its missile attack completely and attempts to close to melee range; if attacked and hurt however, it will still immediately counter-attack with a single missile.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The mancubus (plural: mancubi) is a large and formidable monster shambling about on sturdy, stumpy elephant-like legs, glaring at opponents through hateful green eyes, while dribbling the remains of its victims from a lusting mouth, displaying sharp yellow fangs. To make things worse, its arms have been replaced by huge flamethrowers capable of spouting a rapid series of scathing bursts of flame, which are powered by a pair of fuel tanks grafted onto the obese monster's back.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"The only good thing about fatso is that he's a nice wide target. Good thing, because it takes a lot of hits to puncture him. He pumps out fireballs like there was no tomorrow.".</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A mancubus will make a gurgling/snorting sound that crescendos into a monstrous tiger-like roar when spotting a player. The mancubus is a dangerous opponent, but has a number of exploitable weaknesses. It is slow and makes a large target, so is easy to kill with rapid-fire weapons. The rocket launcher is possibly the most effective weapon against the mancubus. Furthermore, because it will pause briefly before attacking, giving out a distinctive battle cry before firing, it is easy to prevent the attacking using slower weapons to stun, even the super shotgun. When a mancubus does attack, it is helpful to attempt to keep one's distance. Otherwise, the player might take two fireballs instead of just one. When dodging from a greater distance, it is important to avoid over-dodging. With the first two attacks from the mancubus, one fireball will go straight toward the player while the other will fly off diagonally to the other side (to the player's right, then to the player's left); in the third volley, one will go left and one right. This pattern can be figured out and used to avoid mancubus attacks.</li>
            <li>Once a mancubus has begun to attack its target, it continues to fire (if it remains unhurt while firing) until all three bursts have been discharged, even if the target has moved out of its sight. This characteristic of their attack can be abused to cause monster infighting.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The arachnotron is a cybernetic spider-like monster introduced in Doom II. It is structurally the same as the spiderdemon, but weaker, and much smaller in size. Its biological body consists primarily of a large brain with two small arms, and eyes that change color depending on the monster's actions. This body is seated into a metal chassis with four articulated hydraulic legs. Instead of the "super chaingun" of the spiderdemon, it wields a plasma cannon which fires sustained bursts of yellow and green energy projectiles.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>An arachnotron makes a revving, mechanical shriek when alerted. Once the arachnotron locks on to an enemy, it will continue to fire plasma bursts until the target moves out of its field of view, the monster flinches in pain, or it is destroyed. Similar behavior can be observed with the spiderdemon, Wolfenstein SS, and the heavy weapon dude. When it dies, its head explodes into a morass of gore as the mechanical chassis collapses, unleashing a dying sound similar to malfunctioning machinery.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The pain elemental is a Doom II monster that is similar to the cacodemon; they are both floating spheres with a single eye and a large toothy mouth. The main differences in respect to its counterpart are that its hide is leathery brown, it has two small arms akin to the spiderdemon's pair of limbs, and is crowned by only two dark curved horns (similar to the cyberdemon's horns) on the top of its spherical body.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A pain elemental emits a strange, hissing babble upon spotting a player. Instead of shooting a standard projectile, the pain elemental periodically spews lost souls at its opponents from a mouth that flares up with a reddish glow each time one of the minions is delivered. As it does not attack directly, the spherical monster will never be targeted by other monsters, though they may unleash lost souls that will attack monsters that hurt them, at least temporarily. The pain elemental is vulnerable to misdirected attacks from its own children, and will retaliate against them.</li>
            <li>When killed, the pain elemental collapses in on itself and explodes, spawning three lost souls. Unlike the cacodemon, the pain elemental does not usually leave behind a corpse. The only exception occurs when a pain elemental is crushed while it is dying, in which case it will leave a small pool of gibs. The gibs can be resurrected by an arch-vile, creating a ghost monster as a result. This event is one of the most rare occurrences in the game.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The arch-vile is an emaciated, peach-skinned humanoid with a grotesque appearance, including stigmata. It has no flesh around its abdomen, revealing some of its ribcage and spinal column.</p>
          <code class="quote"><span class="quote-title">Quote:</span><br>"One of the worst of a bad lot. You can't think of enough rotten things to say about him. He's fast, hard to kill, casts spells, and resurrects dead monsters! At least these suckers are rare."</code>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>These monsters can take a considerably high amount of damage (700 hit points, the fourth highest in the game), and their attack consists of a unique ability to immolate their enemies in flames by raising their arms up and summoning fire upon the targeted foe, regardless of range (though they will not use their attack from more than 896 map units away unless hurt). They then hunch over and clasp their hands together, causing the fire to erupt, usually sending the enemy flying into the air, while causing up to 90 points in damage. This attack will always hit the enemy as long as there is a line of sight between the arch-vile and the target by the moment when the explosion happens, and can be avoided by staying out of the its line of sight at that moment, which is usually relatively easy since it takes the arch-vile almost two full seconds to do one attack, from when it first calls the fire to when it actually sends out the blast. The blast occurs near the end of the spell. Moving out of the demon's sight does not cause the arch-vile to stop its attack; it always goes through the full sequence unless it flinches after being hit by a third party.</li>
            <li>The arch-vile has the power to resurrect other, lower-level monsters that they come across. They can resurrect all monsters that leave corpses except cyberdemons, spiderdemons, Commander Keens, and other arch-viles. They also cannot resurrect corpses that were placed on map by the level designer. This resurrecting power makes them top priority to kill in battle, to stop them from reviving defeated monsters and forcing the player to spend extra precious ammunition. However, the player does get credit for killing resurrected monsters, so in levels containing an arch-vile the KILLS percentage displayed at the end may exceed 100%.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The Wolfenstein SS (also referred to as the SS Nazi in DeHackEd) is a Nazi Schutzstaffel officer in blue uniform originally from Wolfenstein 3D, who makes an appearance in the secret levels of Doom II, which are re-creations of levels from Wolfenstein 3D. The SS officer appears as a blond, blue-eyed, square-jawed man wearing coveralls and a sidecap, and carries a submachine gun resembling an MP 40. When wounded, the Wolfenstein SS sounds like the former humans.</p>
          <h4>Combat Characteristics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The SS Nazi attacks by firing two bullets at a time, which are slightly less powerful than the player's bullet; like the heavy weapon dude, he fires repeatedly as long as his target is in sight. When killed, the Nazi drops a clip containing five bullets (or 10 on the "I'm too young to die" and "Nightmare!" skill settings). If he subsequently respawns or is resurrected, the clip remains; note however that no official id Software map contains both Nazis and arch-viles.</li>
            <li>Wolfenstein 3D did not feature multiplayer or monster infighting, and as a result, all enemies encountered in-game only had front-facing graphics for attacking. Id Software's artists did not bother to make new attacking graphics for the other angles when they converted the SS Nazi's graphics to Doom II, so the SS Nazi always appears to face the player when firing, no matter where its actual target is. This can be confusing because the Nazis are just as likely to engage in infighting and killing each other as the former humans are. A fix for this technical limitation is available in the form of the Doom Minor Sprite Fixing Project, which also fixes issues (such as offsets) with other NPCs.</li>

        <article>
          <p>Commander Keen is a character named Billy Blaze from a series of eponymous platform games by id Software. An incarnation of the character can be found in the super-secret Doom II map, MAP32: Grosse, as an Easter egg. In the final room of that level four hanged Commander Keen bodies are suspended from ropes by their necks around a metal cube containing the exit switch. The player must destroy the four hanged Keens to trigger the door that hides the switch.<br>
<br>
The Commander Keen can be considered a monster in the technical sense as it counts towards the kills percentage, will respawn under the corresponding settings, and is not included when the -nomonsters parameter is used. It does not, however, pose any threat to the player as the true monsters do.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The final boss (often informally called the Icon of Sin because of the Doom II level of which it is a part) is the final boss of Doom II, in MAP30: Icon of Sin.<br>
<br>
It appears as a massive, goat-like biomechanical head on a wall, with an exposed brain that allows it to spawn endless scores of demons. Although only its head is visible, the endgame text indicates that the entity has a gigantic body as well.<br>
<br>
In Doom II, the boss is not referred to by any specific name. It is referred to in the Final Doom manual's introductory stories as Baphomet and Gatekeeper. In the text screens of TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment, it is called the demon-spitter and the Gatekeeper respectivel</p>
